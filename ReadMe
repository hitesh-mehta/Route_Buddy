# GeoMap Application

This application allows users to input addresses, geocode them using Mapbox API, and visualize the results on a map.

## Project Overview

The GeoMap Application is a web-based tool designed to simplify the process of geocoding addresses and visualizing them on a map. Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), and this application leverages the Mapbox Geocoding API for this purpose.

## Features

- **Address Input:** Users can input addresses via a user-friendly interface.
- **Dynamic Address Addition:** Click "Add Another Address" to dynamically add more address input fields.
- **Geocoding:** Utilizes the Mapbox Geocoding API to convert addresses into coordinates.
- **Map Visualization:** Displays geocoded addresses on an interactive map.
- **Distance Calculation:** Calculates and logs the distance between consecutive addresses.

## How It Works

1. Users input addresses on the main page (`Input_Page.html`).
2. The application geocodes the addresses using the Mapbox Geocoding API.
3. Geocoded data is stored in MongoDB for future use.
4. Users are redirected to `second-page.html` to visualize geocoded addresses on a map.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash

Usage
Enter Addresses:

Input addresses in the provided text fields on the main page (index.html).
Click "Add Another Address" to dynamically add more address input fields.
Get Map Polygon:

After entering addresses, click the "Submit Addresses" button to geocode them and store the data.
Distance Calculation:

The application calculates and logs the distance between consecutive addresses.
Cumulative distance and motorable paths are displayed on the map on the second-page.html.
Logout:

Click the "Logout" button to log out from the application.
